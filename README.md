# UoS Hacktoberfest 2023

Welcome to the Website repo. Your goal is to complete all of the issues outlined in the issues tab of this repo.

#### Rules
1) Clone index.html as a starting base for your solution
2) Add your submissions to the submissions directory, name the file like this "UOS_ID-ISSUE_NAME.html"
3) Multiple people can submit a solution to the same issue

Please add your answers to the "src/submissions" directory with the filename "UOS_ID-ISSUE_NAME.html"
If you want to create your own stylesheet, please create one under the style directory, name it after your
student ID in order to avoid conflict with other submissions. 

For example: s224994.css
