# UoS Hacktoberfest 2023

Welcome to the UOS Hacktoberfest event! To contribute, look at the issues tab, and submit your solutions.

#### Rules
1) Copy index.html as a starting base for your solution

2) When submitting solutions, create a folder under your name in submissions, and save your work there before sending a pull request. (For example. /Submissions/Oliver/index.html)

3) If you want to create your own stylesheet, please create it within your personal directory in the submissions
folder. This is to ensure that the work of other students is kept seperate!

3) Multiple people can submit a solution to the same issue! (But you can't submit another solution to an issue you've already solved, these pull requests will be denied!)




If you need help, feel free to ask! Make sure to follow rules 2 & 3 to ensure correct formatting, otherwise your pull request 
may be declined.
