        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> 
           Our society is for everyone who is interested in Computing. Whether you are a computing student or just someone who wants to add a spark to an existing/new hobby, we have something for everyone!           
           We provide a range of weekly activities on a Wednesday and bring in guests from the computing/technology sector for chats and to network. You don't need to be a member to attend our events!
           If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via email or social media!
